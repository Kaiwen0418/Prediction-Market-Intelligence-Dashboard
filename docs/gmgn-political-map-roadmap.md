# GMGN-Style Political Map Product Roadmap

## Product Thesis

Build a political prediction-market intelligence terminal where the map is the scanner. Users should see where unusual money is moving, select a colored region, understand the signal, and open the relevant trading pair without browsing a wall of election cards.

The product borrows GMGN's useful mental model: rank markets by abnormal activity and make the reason for each alert inspectable. It does not copy token-trading mechanics or present unverified wallet behavior as fact.

## Product Principles

- The map is the primary navigation surface.
- A region is colored only when it has a configured, active trading pair.
- Color communicates signal severity; selection uses an outline and never destroys the color meaning.
- Every alert explains what changed, how unusual it is, and which market is affected.
- Static fixtures, delayed data, and live detections are visibly distinguished.
- One primary pair represents each region on the map. Secondary pairs belong in the selected-region rail.

## Core User Loop

1. Open the global political activity map.
2. Scan regions ranked by abnormal-activity color.
3. Select a region.
4. Inspect the pair, probability, liquidity, signal score, and supporting evidence.
5. Add the region or market to a watchlist, or continue to the execution venue.
6. Receive an alert when the signal changes materially.

## Signal Model

The initial activity score is a 0-100 composite:

```text
activity score =
  30% volume anomaly
  25% order-flow imbalance
  20% probability velocity
  15% wallet concentration
  10% poll or related-market divergence
```

Severity thresholds:

| Score | Severity | Map treatment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0-49 | Normal | Blue |
| 50-69 | Elevated | Amber |
| 70-84 | High | Coral |
| 85-100 | Critical | Red |

The score must include component values, baseline window, observation time, source mode, and confidence before it is promoted from fixture to live.

## Information Architecture
